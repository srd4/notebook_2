# Notebook App

This is basically CRUD application for separating user statements into actionable (tasks) and the rest (ideas), keeping them organized in different container objects. The plan was to work on a simple and useful enough project that would increase my productivity while I went throw the dj4e lectures I learn Django (and remembered Python) HTML, and CSS with.

It replaced a manual system that I was (not) using for separating ideas and tasks on several areas that I refer to as 'systems' which I use to organize myself and make progress on.

## Built With
